After a long and exhilarating day, I am finally creating my first blog post!

I am starting this blog as a way to chronicle my ruby learning experience as well as anything that catches my attention. So if anyone is reading this, I hope you enjoy my journey of progress.

I am currently a student at Atlanta's Iron Yard Academy, where I am beginning my second week of their Ruby on Rails course. The course itself lasts 12 weeks, and is an intense program where students can't help but eat, sleep, and dream about Ruby. We're also going to learn about other software related to Ruby that will help round out our education--personally, I cannot wait to learn about Angular--but enough about that. I'll rave about the Iron Yard and their program in a future post.

I have spent a majority of my afternoon and evening setting up this blog, so I'm quite proud of it's development. In a couple of short hours, I have learned about and set up Jekyll, Github pages, and Heroku. I even purchased my first domain name and linked it to this very blog (pretty snazzy, huh?). A lot of firsts today.

The last thing I've been working on for this blog is setting up a theme. Currently, I cannot get Heroku to recognize scss files. There might be a chance that I may just host this blog on github pages, but I'll give Heroku another shot tomorrow.

Well, that's all I have for now. Good night y'all!
